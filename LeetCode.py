##########1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies ##########
# Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, 
# where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

# For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids 
# such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. 
# Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

class Solution:
